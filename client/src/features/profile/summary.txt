Biggest challenge 
One of my biggest challenge was how to scale myself as I took on more teams under me. What I learned is that you are not going to have enough time to be in every meeting and know all details. So I had
to learn how to leverage my teammates and rely on them. For example, on the Mobile Platform team I was in charge of overseeing the release to ensure all of our tasks get completed in a timely manner
and raise any risks or concerns that can jerporized our release. I couldn't keep up with getting involved in the day to day activities so I can to scale myself and empower my team by creating the Tech Lead Role for QE. I had to define the process
and provide dashboards they can lerverage to track tasks, etc... For every release I would have each QE member be on rotation to oversee the Mobile Platform release which resulted in each team member being accountable and now understanding all the moving parts for being able to release a quality product
